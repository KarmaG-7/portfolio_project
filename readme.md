# Portfolio Project
The current top 20 movies are displayed on the landing page of this project, which is constructed with the help of a movie database API. Furthermore, users can search for movies using any keyword, and the API will return the top 20 movies whose titles contain the user's input.

## How to use
To search for a movie, go to the search area on the landing page. If you enter the exact name of the movie, it will display only that movie. If you don't recall the full title, just type in a few words, and it will show you the top 20 movies with titles that match your search input.

If you require more information on a particular movie, click on its poster. This action will redirect you to a second page where you can find details such as budget, earnings, and a brief summary of the movie.

### Handling error
* If the user clicks on the search button without entering any input, the page will display an alert message that reads "Name of the movie cannot be empty!"
